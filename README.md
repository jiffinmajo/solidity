# Solidity
i am submitted the code that i learnt from the Metacrafters Academy
# Public variables
we are getting started with assigning the name and abbrevation of the token we are gonna create
# Mapping variable
The mapping of the variable is then done on the next step. ie, if we put an address into this, it will simply give back the token balances on that address.
# Mint function
The mint function in is used to mint or generate more tokens to the total supply of that token.
# Burn function
The burn function is used to burn or remove the tokens from the total supply.
we provide an 'if' inorder to avoid burn tokens more than the total supply.
